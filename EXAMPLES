Example 1.

To understand the purpose and usage of MARS please execute the following steps:

1. Upload the file ./data/10.gappy.fasta on http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/. 
   Set the alphabet to DNA and the output format to PHYLIP. Then hit SUBMIT.

2. Inspect the produced MSA.

3. Conduct a typical run of MARS for file ./data/10.gappy.fasta using the following command:
	
	$ ./mars -a DNA -i ./data/10.gappy.fasta -o ./data/10.gappy.output.fasta -q 5 -l 20 -P 1

   The sequences are now refined via cyclic rotations and output in file ./data/10.gappy.output.fasta.	

4. Upload the file ./data/10.gappy.output.fasta on http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/. 
   Set the alphabet to DNA and the output format to PHYLIP. Then hit SUBMIT.

5. Inspect the produced MSA and contrast it to the MSA produced by Step 2.
